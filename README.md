OpenGL
======

Playing around with more recent versions of OpenGL than I am accustomed to.

Take a look here (http://www.justinlycklama.com/projects/OpenGL/) to see a bit about the project.

In its current state it has a light attached to the camera, with textured boxes in front and a couple loaded meshes behind the viewer. The wheels are bump mapped, although bump mapping is not working 100%, so you can see some graphical issues.
